                All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
                Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
                All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
                Enough is enough of this garbage
                All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
            </p>
            <p>
                Skin head, dead head
                Everybody gone bad
                Situation aggravation
                Everybody, allegation
                In the suite on the news
                Everybody, dog food
                Bang-bang, shock dead
                Everybody's gone mad
            </p>
            <p>
                All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
